So in python client server code, the client will send a string of input in this case "private <ID of receiver> <message to be sent>" Now I made an if and else statement like if 'message == "list"', 'message == "changeID"', and such. How do I write the elif for when the client types in  "private <ID of receiver> <message to be sent>" ?



Certainly! To handle the case when the client sends a message in the format "private <ID of receiver> <message to be sent>", you can extract the relevant parts of the input and process them accordingly. Here's how you can write the `elif` block for this scenario:

```python
# Assuming `message` contains the input from the client
message = "private 12345 Hello, this is a private message."

# Split the message into words
words = message.split()

# Check if the message starts with "private" and has at least three words
if len(words) >= 3 and words[0].lower() == "private":
    receiver_id = words[1]  # Extract the receiver ID
    private_message = " ".join(words[2:])  # Extract the message content

    # Now you can handle the private message:
    # - Send it to the receiver with the specified ID
    # - Store it in a database
    # - Perform any other necessary actions

    print(f"Private message to {receiver_id}: {private_message}")
else:
    # Handle other cases (e.g., "list", "changeID", etc.)
    # ...
```

In the above code snippet:
- We split the input message into words using `split()`.
- We check if the first word is "private" (case-insensitive) and if there are at least three words in the message.
- If so, we extract the receiver ID and the message content.
- You can replace the `print` statement with your actual logic for handling private messages (e.g., sending them to the receiver).

Remember to adapt this code to your specific use case and integrate it into your client-server application. Happy coding! 🚀🐍
